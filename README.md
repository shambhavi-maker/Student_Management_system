# Student_Management_system
Student management systems focus on managing students' data, and base their data structures on the individual student level. Here I have build student management system using C++.
Here I have taken 4 parameter for syncing the information of the student :
1.Name
2.Roll no.
3.Course 
4.Class
5.Contact
I have used switch statement to intiate desired process function (enter,show,search,update,delete,exit) as difeerent cases of switch statement .
the main functions are:
1.enter()
2.show()
3.search()
4.update()
5.deleterecord()
then i have intiated different function for specific task requirement like enter() is for inputting data, show() is for showing the data of all the student and update() is for updating the specific data , deleterecord() for deleting all or specific data , exit() is to exit the program.
hope above information is usefull enough to understand the code .
